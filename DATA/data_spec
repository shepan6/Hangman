This file will briefly describe the data to be measured during gameplay
to allow for future user experience analysis

- Username : name user inputted into the game instance. This will obviously
 bring complications, including whether two games conducted with the same username actually
 comes from the same user. A workaround would be a personalised profile (with a password).
 However, for simplicity, we will omit this capability.
- Action : users action, which is split into 3 main events (started game [sg], started round[sr]
(where r will represent the round number), input character [i_] (_ refers to the
 character inputted), completed round [cr], completed game [cg], quit game [qg]).
This will be stored as two-character string to reduce memory whilst allowing for
human interpretability of the data.
- Time : This will record the time point when a user conducted a certain action.
This will be stored as a datetime object to allow for both macro- (date-level) and micro-
(second/minute-level) analyses of user experience.
