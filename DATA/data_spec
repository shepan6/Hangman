This file will briefly describe the scoreboard data and ux data, which will be measure during gameplay
to allow for future user experience analysis

SCOREBOARD
---------
Firstly, the program will assume that games played byt he same username will be attributed to a single user.

- Username : This will be the index column.
- Points : This will contain number of total points across all games.

UX DATA
---------
- Username : name user inputted into the game instance. This will obviously
 bring complications, including whether two games conducted with the same username actually
 comes from the same user. A workaround would be a personalised profile (with a password).
 However, for simplicity, we will omit this capability.
- Action : users action, which is split into 3 main events (started game [sg], input character [i_] (_ refers to the
 character inputted), completed game [cg], quit game [qg]).
This will be stored as two-character string to reduce memory whilst allowing for
human interpretability of the data.
- Time : This will record the time point when a user conducted a certain action.
This will be stored as a datetime object to allow for both macro- (date-level) and micro-
(second/minute-level) analyses of user experience.
